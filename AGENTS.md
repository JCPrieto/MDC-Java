# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

Source code lives under `src/main/java` with packages rooted at `es.jklabs` (GUI in `es.jklabs.gui`, utilities in
`es.jklabs.utilidades`). Static resources go in `src/main/resources`. Assembly packaging config is in
`src/assembly/cfg.xml`. Build outputs are written to `target/`. Launch scripts are provided as `MCD Java.sh` and
`MCD Java.bat`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `mvn clean package` builds the app, copies runtime dependencies into `target/libs`, and produces the runnable jar in
  `target/`.
- `mvn test` runs tests (none are currently defined).
- `./MCD Java.sh` or `MCD Java.bat` runs the packaged app using the provided scripts.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Use Java 21 language features only. Indent with 4 spaces and keep opening braces on the same line as declarations.
Packages are lowercase (`es.jklabs...`), classes use PascalCase, methods and fields use camelCase. Much of the Swing UI
is generated by a GUI builder; avoid editing code between `//GEN-BEGIN` and `//GEN-END` markers unless you regenerate
it.

## Testing Guidelines

There are no automated tests in this repository yet. If you add non-trivial logic, place tests under `src/test/java` and
document how to run them with `mvn test` in your PR.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Recent commits use short, descriptive messages (often Spanish) and include clear version or dependency updates when
relevant. Follow the same style and keep commits focused. For pull requests, include a brief summary, testing steps, and
screenshots for UI changes. Link any related issues or changelog entries.

## Release Notes & Artifacts

Bump the version in `pom.xml` before release. Build with `mvn clean package`, then publish the jar from `target/` (and
its `target/libs` dependencies if distributing outside Maven). If you update the GUI or behavior, add a short changelog
entry in the PR description.

## Configuration & Dependencies

The project targets Java 11. Linux notifications depend on LibNotify. Dependencies are managed in `pom.xml` (currently
Apache Commons Lang); update versions there and rebuild with Maven when changing libraries.
